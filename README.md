# LLM-Timeseries-Evaluation

Reference-free evaluation of time-series explanations using an LLM-as-a-Judge framework with structured rubric-based scoring.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and results for **TSQueryBench**. We study large language models as both generators and evaluators of time-series explanations in a reference-free setting, using a rubric-guided prompting framework that conditions directly on raw numerical data.
